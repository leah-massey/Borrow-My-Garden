# Motivation

**Lack of Allotment spaces**
Demand for allotment spaces has risen by over 200% in recent years and wait lists for a plot are often exceeding 15 years.
In tandem with this increased desire for a small plot of land, since the 1950s there has been a reduction of 65% on allotment land in the UK. Sheffield univeristy
Borrow My Garden serves dramatically increase the availability of green growing spaces.

**UK Mental Health Crisis**
Our increasingly busy and stressful lives have resulted in a mental Health crisis across the UK. Contibuting factors include - lack of community, increased screen time, social media, a distancing from nature. It is proven that gardening reduces depression, anxiety and other stress related symptoms.
Borrow My Garden directly will make it easy for users to reap the benefits of gardening. It will also connect neighbours and establish strong community bonding.

**The Cost of Living**
The cost of living in the UK is soaring with food prices being particularly affected.
Borrow My Garden will give users the opportunity to grow their own food and by doing so significantly reduce their cost of living.

## Challenges
<p>For this project, we wanted to push ourselves and try using the (new-to-us) technology, MongoDB Atlas. This path meant that we struggled to implement some of the features of the application, most significantly we struggled to implement the messaging feature whereby users can connect with other users and have a private thread of conversation. </p>

## Technologies

<p>We set up a React framework from scratch for this project. </p>
<p>We used MongoDB Atlas.</p>
<p>Another new technology that we introduced to this project was Chakra. This was to aid the final design styling of the application. i think with a little more time for learning, there is much more to gain from this tool</p>
