# Motivation

**Lack of Allotment spaces**
Demand for allotment spaces has risen by over 200% in recent years and wait lists for a plot are often exceeding 15 years.
In tandem with this increased desire for a small plot of land, since the 1950s there has been a reduction of 65% on allotment land in the UK. Sheffield univeristy
Borrow My Garden serves dramatically increase the availability of green growing spaces.

**UK Mental Health Crisis**
Our increasingly busy and stressful lives have resulted in a mental Health crisis across the UK. Contibuting factors include - lack of community, increased screen time, social media, a distancing from nature. It is proven that gardening reduces depression, anxiety and other stress related symptoms.
Borrow My Garden directly will make it easy for users to reap the benefits of gardening. It will also connect neighbours and establish strong community bonding.

**The Cost of Living**
The cost of living in the UK is soaring with food prices being particularly affected.
Borrow My Garden will give users the opportunity to grow their own food and by doing so significantly reduce their cost of living.

# Install

# Getting Started with Create React App

`git clone https://github.com/jpates1/borrow-my-garden`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
